# About Me
I’m [Shann], a final-year engineering student on my way to becoming a **backend developer**.  
Right now, I’m focused on **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and understanding how things actually work behind the scenes.

**WIMS.dev** stands for *What’s In My Stack* - I document my learning journey here to share knowledge and track progress in various areas such as Java, DSA, and software development best practices.
