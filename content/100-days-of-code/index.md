# 100 Days of Code

This is my ongoing log of coding, learning, and consistency.  
Each phase has its own theme and goal — and right now, it’s time for something deeper.

## ❄️ Winter Arc (Current Phase)

The **Winter Arc** is my focused phase of this journey — 100 days of building my backend foundation with intent.

**Focus areas:**
- Mastering Java fundamentals and JVM concepts  
- Writing production-style Spring Boot code  
- Practicing DSA daily with reasoning  
- Building a few real-world mini-projects  
- Staying consistent no matter what

**Goal:**  
End this winter with a strong foundation and the discipline to keep improving.
