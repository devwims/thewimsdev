# Welcome to WIMS.dev

I’m [Shann], a final-year engineering student on my way to becoming a **backend developer**.  
Right now, I’m focused on **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and understanding how things actually work behind the scenes.

**WIMS.dev** stands for *What’s In My Stack* — it’s my place to write, document, and keep track of what I’m learning.  
Nothing fancy — just clean notes, working code, and honest progress.

## What’s Here

### Effective Java
Notes and examples from *Effective Java*.  
I write down what I learn in a way that makes sense to me — practical and to the point.

### 100 Days of Code
A log of what I’m working on each day.  
Some days are great, some are rough — the point is to keep going.

### Core Java
Everything about Java I’m trying to master — language features, memory model, concurrency, and all the small details that matter.

### DSA
My notes and solutions for data structures and algorithms.  
Focusing on writing clean logic, not just passing test cases.

### Spring Boot
Learning to build backends that actually work in the real world — REST APIs, services, and projects.

### Projects
Personal and college projects.  
Each one represents something I wanted to try or learn from scratch.

### Blog
Occasional thoughts — small posts about code, workflow, or mindset.

## Why I’m Doing This

I’ve realized that writing things down makes me understand them better.  
This site helps me stay consistent and track how much I’ve grown over time.
